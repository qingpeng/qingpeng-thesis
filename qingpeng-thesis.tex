\begin{abstract}
%% Type your abstract here. An abstract is REQUIRED and limited to two pages.
%% The abstract must not include any figures.
Species diversity is an important measurement of ecological communities.
Scientists believe that there is a strong relationship between species
diversity and ecosystem processes. However efforts to investigate microbial
diversity using whole genome shotgun reads data are still scarce. 
With novel applications of data structures
and the development of novel algorithms, firstly we developed an efficient k-mer counting
approach and approaches to enable scalable streaming analysis of large and 
error-prone short-read shotgun data sets. Then based on these efforts, we developed a 
statistical framework allowing for scalable diversity analysis of large,
complex metagenomes without the need for assembly or reference sequences. This
method is evaluated on multiple large metagenomes from different
environments, such as seawater, human microbiome, soil. Given the velocity in
growth of sequencing data, this method is promising for analyzing highly
diverse samples with relatively low computational requirements. Further, as the
method does not depend on reference genomes, it also provides opportunities to
tackle the large amounts of unknowns we find in metagenomic
datasets.

First and foremost, I would like to sincerely thank my advisor, Dr. C. Titus 
Brown, for his insightful guidance, his generous support, his confidence in 
me, and especially his patience and encouragement when progress was slow. 
It's been an honor and a privilege working with you, Titus!

Next I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. James Cole, Dr. Richard 
Enbody, Dr. Yanni Sun and Dr. Eric Torng, for their valuable input to my 
research and their review of this dissertation. I am also indebted to the 
collaborators, including Dr. Shana Goffredi, Yiseul Kim, Dr. Joan Rose, Dr. Tom Schmidt, 
Dr. Tracy Teal, Dr. James Tiedje, and
Dr. Susannah Tringe. I learned from their insights a lot. 

I would also like to thank the GED lab members, who are also my best friends.
I thank Dr. Sherine Awad, Michael Crusoe, Jiarong Guo, Luiz Irber and Camille 
Scott for their excellent collaborative ideas and their generous help with my 
preparation of this dissertation and the defense. I should not forget several
former members of the GED lab, including Rose Canino-Koning, Dr. Elijah Lowe, 
Eric McDonald, Dr. Kanchan Pavangadkar, Dr. Jason Pell, Dr. Likit Preeyanon, and Neem Serra. 
I really miss the time we worked together. Your 
work is very important to the success of my project. Thanks you!

To all my friends, thank you for the support and encouragement. A big thank
to Dr. Adina Howe, a colleague, mentor and friend, for everything.

%%%%%% LANDSCAPE PAGES  %%%%%%
%% To produce graphics or tables in landscape mode,
%% begin by removing the "%" in the next two lines.
%\begin{landscape}
%\thispagestyle{empty}
%% The contents of the page can be centered using the center environment
%% or the \centering command. Insert either a table with the tabular environment
%% or input a graphics file.
%% Use \captionof{table}{caption_text} (or figure in place of table) 
%% to create the caption for a short table or a figure. 
%% Insert a long table in a table environment. It disables double spacing
%% which is permitted for long tables.  Finally remove the "%" from the next line.
%\end{landacape}

%%%%%%%    APPENDICES    %%%%%%%%%%
%% If you wish to include just one appendix, remove the "%" 
%% in front of \appendix below. To include two or more appendices,
%% remove the "%" in front of \appendices.
%\appendix
%\appendices

%% In either cast to start your first appendix, which will be labeled
%% as Appendix A, just type \chapter{appendix 1 name}
%% and enter the text of the appendix as you would a chapter,
%% with one exception. If you use any subdivisions, such as 
%% section, subsection etc., use the starred version; that is,
%% \section*{section name}.  Such subdivisions are not to be 
%% listed in the Table of Contents.

%%%%%%% A NOTE ABOUT APPENDICES %%%%%%%%%
%% Some appendices may be single-spaced such as survey examples
%% or letters. See the Graduate School's formatting guide for details.
%% To single space an appendix first remove the "%" from 
%% the following two lines.
%\end{doublespace}
%\chapter{<appendix name>}
%% Insert the name of the appendix.
%% Insert the text of the appendix.
%% Remove the "%" from the following line.
%\begin{doublespace}
%% Any text entered now will be double spaced.

%%%%%%  Bibliography %%%%%
%% A bibliography is required. By default it is called, "Bibliography"
%% You may use “Literature Cited”, “Works Cited” or “References” 
%% instead of “Bibliography” if that is the convention in your discipline. 
%% To do so, place your choice in the  empty argument 
%% of the following command and remove the "%".
%\renewcommand{\bibname}{}

%% The bibliography may be made using BibTeX.
%% To do so the necessary commands must be entered in the 
%% preamble and here.
%% If the Bibliography is made from scratch,
%% remove the "%" in front of \begin{thebibliography}{???}
%% replacing the ??? with the appropriate entry and 
%% remove the "%" in front of \end{thebibliography} below.
% \begin{thebibliography}{???}
%%  Enter the bibliography here.
% \end{thebibliography}
%% In either case, the bibliography is automatically entered
%% in the Table of Contents.

%%%%%% A FINAL COMMENT %%%%
%% Once your document has been filed with the Graduate School,
%% if you wish to produce a single spaced version of your document, 
%% find and remove the commands \begin{doublespace}
%% and \end{doublespace} above.
