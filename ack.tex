First and foremost, I would like to sincerely thank my advisor, Dr. C. Titus 
Brown, for his insightful guidance, his generous support, his confidence in 
me, and especially his patience and encouragement when progress was slow. I 
feel honored to be your student, Titus!

Next I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. James Cole, Dr. Richard 
Enbody, Dr. Yanni Sun and Dr. Eric Torng, for their valuable input to my 
research and their review of this dissertation. I am also indebted to my 
collaborators, Dr. Shana Goffredi, Dr. Joan Rose, Dr. James Tiedje, and
Dr. Susannah Tringe. I learned from their insights a lot. 

I would also like to thank the GED lab members, who are also my best friends.
I thank Dr. Sherine Awad, Michael Crusoe, Jiarong Guo, Luiz Irber and Camille 
Scott for their excellent collaborative ideas and their generous help with my 
preparation of this dissertation and the defense. I should not forget several
former members of the GED lab, Eric McDonald, Dr. Jason Pell, Dr. Likit 
Preeyanon and Dr. Elijah Lowe. I really miss the time we worked together. Your 
work is very important to the success of my project. Thanks you!

To all my friends, thank you for the support and encouragement. A big thank
to Dr. Adina Howe, a colleague, mentor and friend, for everything.
